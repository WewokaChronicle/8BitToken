## **HOW THE TOKEN SALE WILL WORK**

Our tokens will be purchasable with **Ether** (ETH). You will need an
Ethereum wallet and Ether (ETH) in your wallet on the day of our token
sale. There are many options to acquiring ETH; listed below is an example
of the steps to acquire ETH using the Coinbase exchange.

### **Obtain Ether through An Exchange**

There are many ways to buy Ethereum, we will use Coinbase for this
example (verify that it is [available for use in your country](https://www.coinbase.com/global?r=ofir)):

1. Open a[ Coinbase](https://99bitcoins.com/coinbase/) account

2. Add your payment method (Credit card or bank account)

3. Go to "Buy/Sell" and select the amount of Ethereum you desire

4. Click "Buy Ethereum"

(Note: The exchange you use will likely sell you ETH for a fee and is dependent on your payment method.)

### **Setting up a Wallet**

Our token sale of 8Bit Tokens will require that you have a personal
Ethereum wallet (off of Coinbase or the exchange you choose) that
supports contracts.[ Ethereum.org](http://Ethereum.org) suggests the Mist Wallet (available[ here](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases),
simply choose your OS) with installation instructions[ here](https://medium.com/@attores/step-by-step-guide-getting-started-with-ethereum-mist-wallet-772a3cc99af4).
It will take between 6 and 72 hours to fully install Mist and allow it to
sync the entire blockchain locally on your computer. If you choose Mist
makes sure you allot yourself enough time to have it fully installed
before the token sale begins.

Another option is to select a wallet that accesses your information
through the internet, but can be substantiated locally. Try[ MyEtherWallet.com](http://myethewallet.com/),
to establish your personal wallet that is accessible through a web
browser. Instructions for using and setting it up are[ here](https://www.cryptocompare.com/wallets/guides/how-to-use-myetherwallet/).

Either of these wallet solutions will allow you to securely store your
Ether in a personal wallet and provide you access to the token sale
contract when it is available.
